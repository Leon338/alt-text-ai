# Cloudflare AI-Powered Alt Text Generator

Generate SEO-optimized, accessibility-friendly alt text for images using Cloudflareâ€™s AI. Upload images or provide image URLs, and receive concise, keyword-rich descriptions in multiple languages.

## Features
- Generate SEO-friendly alt text for images
- Supports multiple languages: English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai
- Works with image uploads or URLs
- Powered by Cloudflare Workers

### Known Limitations

While the AI-powered alt text generator provides useful descriptions, there are some known issues:
- **Quality of Alt Tags**: The generated alt tags are generally good, but in some cases, they may not be perfectly accurate or descriptive, particularly for complex images.
- **Language Support**: Although the model supports multiple languages, the quality of alt tags in languages other than English may be lower, and some languages may produce less accurate results.

### Future Improvements

One potential enhancement to improve the quality of the generated alt tags is to integrate a **second AI model** to validate the alt text before returning it. This secondary model could cross-check the description for accuracy, clarity, and language appropriateness, ensuring better results across all supported languages.
